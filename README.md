# 🚫 SecureBrowse Adult Content Blocker
## ❤️ Mission

Many people struggle to avoid explicit content online.  
**SecureBrowse** helps users regain control — not by spying or judging — but by simply removing temptation before it appears.

This project is built with the goal of *digital purity* and *mental focus* for everyone.

> “If you can’t control what you see, you can’t control what you think.”

> **“Protect your focus. Protect your faith.”**  
> SecureBrowse is a smart, rule-based desktop filter that automatically detects and blocks adult or NSFW websites at the browser level — before they can even load.
